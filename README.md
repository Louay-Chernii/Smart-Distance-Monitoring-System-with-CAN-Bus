# Smart Distance Monitoring System with CAN Bus

## Project Overview

The Smart Distance Monitoring System is an embedded project using the STM32F407VG Discovery Kit. It measures distance using an HC-SR04 ultrasonic sensor and displays the readings on a 16x2 I2C LCD. The system features CAN bus communication to send distance data to a central node, with alert mechanisms like LEDs and a buzzer for distance threshold breaches. This project was completed in collaboration with my colleague, Wafe Tlili, and with the support of Centre Sup√©rieur de Formation.

## Features

- **Distance Measurement**: Uses the HC-SR04 ultrasonic sensor to measure distances.
- **Real-time Display**: Displays the measured distance on a 16x2 I2C LCD.
- **CAN Bus Communication**: Transmits distance data to a central STM32F407 node.
- **Alert Mechanisms**:
  - Blue and Green LEDs to indicate different distance ranges.
  - Buzzer activation when distance exceeds 10 cm.
  - Push button to deactivate the buzzer.
- **Modular Design**: Two nodes - one for distance measurement and one central node for data aggregation.

## Components

1. **STM32F407VG Discovery Kit**
2. **HC-SR04 Ultrasonic Sensor**: For distance measurement.
3. **16x2 I2C LCD**: For displaying the measured distance.
4. **CAN Bus**: For communication between nodes.
5. **Buzzer**: For auditory alerts.
6. **LEDs**: Blue and green LEDs for visual distance indication.
7. **Push Button**: For deactivating the buzzer.

## System Architecture

### Nodes

1. **Distance Measurement Node**:
   - Interfaced with HC-SR04 sensor and 16x2 I2C LCD.
   - Measures distance and displays it.
   - Sends distance data via CAN bus.

   Below is a figure that describes the interfacing of the Distance Measurement Node:

2. **Central Node**:
   - Receives distance data from the measurement node.
   - Manages alert mechanisms (LEDs, Buzzer).
   - Processes data to determine when to activate/deactivate alerts.
