# Smart-Distance-Monitoring-System-with-CANBus
This project consists of two nodes: one for distance measurement using an HC-SR04 sensor and a 16x2 character LCD, and another central node that processes the data and activates a buzzer and LED if the distance exceeds 10 cm. The nodes communicate via CAN bus, providing real-time monitoring and alerts.
